You could deploy the model as a [real-time hosted endpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/how-it-works-deployment.html) on SageMaker and integrate it with Snowflake as an [External Function](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/external-functions-creating-aws.html). This will enable you to query your predictions in real-time and minimize data staleness.\n",

    "Alternatively, you can pre-calculate your predictions as a transient batch process. In the following section, you will use [Batch Transform](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/batch-transform.html) to do just that. When your use case allows you to pre-calculate predictions, Batch Transform is a good option. Batch Transform design to scale-out and is optimized for throughput while the real-time endpoints are designed for low latency. Generally, Batch Transform is the cost efficient option as you are only charged for the resources used by the transient batch job. You should run your Batch Transform job as part of an automated workflow in production.\n",
